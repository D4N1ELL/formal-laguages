## Theory

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; A finite automaton is a mechanism used to represent processes of different kinds. It can be compared to a state machine as they both have similar structures and purpose as well. The word finite signifies the fact that an automaton comes with a starting and a set of final states. In other words, for process modeled by an automaton has a beginning and an ending.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Based on the structure of an automaton, there are cases in which with one transition multiple states can be reached which causes non determinism to appear. In general, when talking about systems theory the word determinism characterizes how predictable a system is. If there are random variables involved, the system becomes stochastic or non deterministic.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; That being said, the automata can be classified as non-/deterministic, and there is in fact a possibility to reach determinism by following algorithms which modify the structure of the automaton.

## Objectives:

1. Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.

2. Continuing the work in the same repository and the same project, the following need to be added:

   a. Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy.

   b. For this you can use the variant from the previous lab.

3. According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the finite automaton definition and do the following tasks:

   a. Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar.

   b. Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.

   c. Implement some functionality that would convert an NDFA to a DFA.

   d. Represent the finite automaton graphically (Optional, and can be considered as a __*bonus point*__):

    - You can use external libraries, tools or APIs to generate the figures/diagrams.

    - Your program needs to gather and send the data about the automaton and the lib/tool/API return the visual representation.

Please consider that all elements of the task 3 can be done manually, writing a detailed report about how you've done the conversion and what changes have you introduced. In case if you'll be able to write a complete program that will take some finite automata and then convert it to the regular grammar - this will be **a good bonus point**.

## Conclusions
During this laboratory work i learned how to implement grammar rules and finite automation in code and also strengthened my understandings about this course.
